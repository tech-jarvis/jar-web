# A join table associating a {User} with a {Project} he is a member of. While it
# is implied that a project's owner is also a member, a Membership is created to
# that effect as well, just to be thorough.
#
# Memberships can be marked as `admin`, in which case they can create and delete
# other memberships. Only the project owner can confer and revoke admin status,
# or assign project ownership to another user.
#
