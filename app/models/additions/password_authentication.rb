# Adds password-based authentication to the {User} model. Mixed in if this
# Squash install is configured to use password-based authentication.
#
# All Users require a primary email. To facilitate this for password-based
# installs, a virtual attribute called "email_address" is added to the User
# model and exposed on the signup form. When the User is created, this attribute
# is used to create the primary email address.
