# An indication that a User wishes to be notified should a Bug occur over a
# certain threshold within a certain period of time. If the threshold is
# exceeded, an email is sent. The threshold then resets for the length of the
# period.
#
# The actual monitoring of the threshold and delivery of emails is handled by
# {OccurrenceObserver}.
